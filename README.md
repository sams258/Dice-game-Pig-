# 🐷 PIG dice game

## 🎲 About the game  
- **PIG** is a simple dice game with two players (Computervs. Human or Human vs. Human). 
- Each player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold". 
- The player who first scores 100 or more points wins

### 📖 Game rules:
- The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points.                                     
- On each turn, the player rolls a six-sided die. 
- If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they receive no points.                                       
- If the player rolls any other number, they can choose to roll again or hold to keep score.                                                              
- If a player chooses to hold their turn, total is added to their score.
- If the player chooses to player against the computer, the player should choose Game difficulty 
which weill reflect the inteliigence of the computer player. 
- The player may choose from two options, 1 for easy mode  and 2 for hard mode. 
- If the player decided to play in easy mode, 
the computer will stop rolling when it reaches score of 15 in that round 
or it rolls a 1 and that round score will be 0.
- If the player decided to play in hard mode,
 the computer will stop rolling when it reaches score of 25 in that round
  or it rolls a 1 and that round score will be 0.


## 🐍 About the project

### 📝 The assignment

This is assignment two of **Methods for Sustainable Programming** course **DA115B**.
<br>The project is created and maintained by Ahmed Radwan and Sam El Saati.
<br>Programming Language used: Python.

### ⚠️ Known issues

1- We prioritized flake8, pylint, unit testing and coverage to meet the deadline.
<br>2- We could not generate uml diagrams automatically using pyreverse.
<br>3- We used longer functions in our main classes since we started without knowing about TDD.

### 🙏 To respect the given deadline:
We decided not to test (game.py, main.py) as they are our main classes.
