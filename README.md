Assignment project
This is assignment two for Methods for Sustainable Programming course DA115B.

## About the project

1- We prioritized flake8, pylint, test and coverage to meet the deadline.

2- We could not generate uml diagrams automatically using pyreverse
3- To respect the given deadline:
 we decided not to test (game.py, main.py) as they are our main classes
