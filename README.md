# 🐷 PIG dice game

## 🎲 About the game  
- **PIG** is a simple dice game with two players (Computervs. Human or Human vs. Human). 
- Each player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold". 
- The player who first scores 100 or more points wins

### 📖 Game rules:
- The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points.                                     
- On each turn, the player rolls a six-sided die. 
- If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they receive no points.                                       
- If the player rolls any other number, they can choose to roll again or hold to keep score.                                                              
- If a player chooses to hold their turn, total is added to their score.

<br>The project is created and maintained by Ahmed Radwan and Sam El Saati.
<br>Programming Language used: Python.

### 🙏 To respect the given deadline:
We decided not to test (game.py, main.py) as they are our main classes.
