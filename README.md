# Dice-game-Pig-
Assignment project
This is assignment two for Methods for Sustainable Programming course DA115B.
The project will be created and maintained by Ahmed Radwan and Sam El Saati.


## About the project

1- We prioritized flake8, pylint, test and coverage to meet the deadline.
2- We could not generate uml diagrams automatically using pyreverse.

### To respect the given deadline:
we decided not to test (game.py, main.py) as they are our main classes.

## About the Pig Dice Game

### Game rules:
The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points.                                     
On each turn, the player rolls a six-sided die. 
If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they receive no points.                                       
If the player rolls any other number, they can choose to roll again or hold to keep score.                                                              
If a player chooses to hold their turn, total is added to their score.
